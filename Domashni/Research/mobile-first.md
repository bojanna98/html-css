# Mobile First
The term “mobile first” is a concept used in web design and the conception of websites. Based on this concept, an optimized version for mobile devices is created first and then expanded. 
Thus the “mobile first” strategy follows the trend that more and more users are surfing the Internet with their smartphone or tablet, and not with the desktop.
## The advantages
If you follow the mobile first strategy, you will benefit from many advantages. Firstly, Mobile First follows the current trend of the increase in mobile usage, as the mobile optimization happens at the beginning of the website design. The desktop version of a website can also benefit from mobile first, as it is not just a design approach - it is also a content-based approach, as only the most essential content is used. It is still possible to expand the site later without any problems. Moreover, a webpage that is optimized for mobile devices can be more easily adapted to new developments, since its structure is much leaner than a conventionally programmed website.
## Criticism of mobile first
Critics believe that the concept of a website is very limited by the mobile-first-principle. Although many pages are now optimized for mobile user-friendliness, the user experience on desktop would also suffer because the usability would be unnecessarily uncomplicated. For example, one would have to search for individual control panels in hidden navigation bars.A further criticism is that pages created for mobile devices may appear to minimalistic in the desktop version.
